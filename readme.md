# Cryptography Project

This project aims to implement various classical ciphers and modern cryptographic techniques using Python and JavaScript. Each cipher will be implemented both as a class-based and function-based solution.

## Implemented Ciphers:

1. **Reverse Cipher:** A simple cipher that reverses the plaintext.
2. **Caesar Cipher:** A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
3. Transposition Cipher
4. Affine Cipher
5. Simple Substitution Cipher
6. The Vigenere Cipher
7. One-time Pad Cipher
8. Public-key Cryptography and RSA Cipher
